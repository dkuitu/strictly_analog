## Comments:
### Wk. 3:
* Gantt looks good.
* Commit msgs are good.
* Lots of commits being made directly on master.
* Good use of issues, todos.

### Wk. 4:
* Some Tasks in Gantt not marked completed and days are now in past. Examples, display the cart, Input validation.
Change dates or mark completed.
* Commit msgs. are good although it appears to be mostly Jeannette and Tyler. Is everyone contributing?
* Branching and Merging much better. Good job!
* Issues being used. Keep it up! Use it as a 'ToDO' list and any bugs or ideas.
